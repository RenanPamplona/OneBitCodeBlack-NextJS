This project was built during the course OneBitCode Black, where the main objetive was to learn more about the use of NextJs and its features, such as:

- The organization of the folders as routes of the application
- Api management inside NextJS
- SSR (Server side Rendering)
- SSG (Static Site Generation)
- ISR (Incremental Static Regeneration)

We also used Typescript during the project to make the development faster and more effective


## Application Features
